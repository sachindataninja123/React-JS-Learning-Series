        Every journey begins with a simple step, but what truly matters is the
        consistency and dedication that follow. Growth doesn’t happen in a
        single day; it happens through small actions repeated with patience,
        discipline, and belief. Challenges will come, doubts may appear, and
        progress might feel slow, but persistence always leads to transformation
