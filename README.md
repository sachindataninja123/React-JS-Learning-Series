# 🚀 React JS Learning Series (Updated Version)

This repository contains my **new React learning journey**, built from scratch after learning React again from another source.  
Even though I already uploaded a previous React series, this one is more organized and covers the fundamentals step-by-step.

I created this repo to:

- Re-learn React from basics with a fresh perspective
